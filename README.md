Yale PUI Plugin
------------------------------

This is an ArchivesSpace plugin to customize the public interface as follows:
* Transform record identifier series-level component ids from Arabic to Roman.
* Suppress extents with a number "0".
* Suppress note headers for notes over 65k that have been split due to AS
database limits.  Labels for split notes follow the convention of a numeral
prefix e.g. "(1) My Split Note", "(2) My Split Note", etc.
* Add a link to the OPAC on resource pages using the OPAC Id in a user_defined
string_2.
* Add a Handle link on resource pages using the EAD ID value (this should be updated, though, to use the finding aid location value, instead)

This plugin will run under ArchivesSpace v2.1 or higher.

Developed by Hudson Molonglo for Yale University.

# Configuration

The OPAC link is currently generated from the OPAC Id in the resource's user
defined `string_2` field.  If your OPAC Id is stored elsewhere, please modify
the file `public/models/resource_ext.rb` to return the value from your desired
field.  The link header, label and URL may be modified via the locales
e.g. `public/locales/en.yml` for English.  Please note, the OPAC Id is passed
to the `opac_link_url` and you can move this value within the URL with the
`%{opac_id}` notation.
